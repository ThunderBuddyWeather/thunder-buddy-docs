# Standup Guide

This guide outlines tasks for a Scrum Master and provides a script for running end-of-day standups.

---

## Before the Standup

1. **Review the Sprint Board & Updates**  
   - Check the current sprint board for task updates throughout the day.  
   - Note any tasks that remain incomplete or have unexpected blockers.  
   - Gather any updates or comments from team communication channels.

2. **Gather Key Metrics or Updates**  
   - Look for any performance indicators or issues flagged during the day.  
   - Identify topics that may need a brief discussion during the standup.

3. **Prepare Your Agenda**  
   - Outline the purpose: to review today's accomplishments, identify unresolved issues, and set the stage for tomorrow.
   - Note any specific follow-up items or blockers that might require additional discussion after the standup.

4. **Set Your Environment**  
   - Ensure you’re in a distraction-free area.
   - Have any necessary tools (e.g., timer, updated board, notes) ready to guide the meeting.

## End-of-Day Standup Script

*Greeting & Introduction (0-1 minute):*  
> **Scrum Master:**  
> “Good evening, everyone. Let’s have a quick standup. Today, we’ll review what we accomplished, discuss any blockers or issues that remain, and note items to kick off tomorrow.”

*Round-Robin Updates (1-10 minutes):*  
> **Scrum Master:**  
> “Let’s go around the room. Please share your updates in this format:
>
> 1. What you accomplished today.
> 2. Any blockers or unresolved issues from today.  
> 3. What you plan to tackle first thing tomorrow (if known).”

- **Tip:** Encourage brevity. If an issue needs in-depth discussion, make a note and schedule a follow-up conversation.

*Highlighting Blockers & Follow-Up Items (Throughout):*  
> **Scrum Master:**  
> “I’m noting any blockers or unresolved tasks. Please flag any issues that might delay tomorrow’s start so we can address them right away or immediately after this meeting.”

*Wrap-Up & Action Items (10-15 minutes):*  
> **Scrum Master:**  
> “Thanks, everyone. To summarize, here are the key takeaways from today:
>
> - **Accomplishments:** [Brief list of major wins]
>
> - **Blockers/Issues:**  
>   - [Blocker 1]: [Brief description]  
>   - [Blocker 2]: [Brief description]
> - **Tomorrow’s Focus:** [Any important tasks or starting points mentioned]
>
> I’ll follow up on the blockers right after this meeting and update our board accordingly. If there are any further comments, please share them now or reach out later.”

## Post-Standup Tasks

1. **Follow-Up on Blockers**  
   - Meet with individuals to resolve any issues or obstacles flagged during the meeting.  
   - Coordinate with external teams or stakeholders if needed.

2. **Update Artifacts**  
   - Record action items and update your sprint board or tracking tool with the latest status.  
   - Document any decisions or changes that came up during the standup.

3. **Plan for Tomorrow**  
   - Share any important reminders or follow-up points with the team as needed (via email or team chat).  
   - Ensure that any unresolved tasks are clearly visible for the start of the next day.

4. **Team Check-In**  
   - Keep an eye on team communications and progress overnight, if applicable.  
   - Be available for any quick clarifications or support before the next day starts.
